LangChain used Hugging Face under the hood to:

    Connect to the Hugging Face Hub

    Find the model with ID crumb/nano-mistral

    Download the necessary files to run it locally on your machine


| File                        | Purpose                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `tokenizer_config.json`     | Configuration for how text is tokenized      |
| `tokenizer.model` / `.json` | Tokenization rules (maps text to tokens)     |
| `model.safetensors`         | The actual trained model weights (\~340MB)   |
| `config.json`               | Model settings like architecture, layers     |
| `generation_config.json`    | Text generation defaults (e.g., temperature) |

ðŸ§  Why "on first run"?
Because once it's downloaded:

    These files are cached locally (under ~/.cache/huggingface)

    On next runs, Hugging Face will reuse the local copy, so it will load instantly and not redownload

Youâ€™ll only see those progress bars once per model.


LangChainâ€™s HuggingFacePipeline, it downloads files to:
~/.cache/huggingface/ (C:\Users\<your-username>\.cache\huggingface\)

The directory typically contains:
huggingface
â””â”€â”€ hub
    â””â”€â”€ models--crumb--nano-mistral
        â”œâ”€â”€ blobs/
        â”œâ”€â”€ refs/
        â”œâ”€â”€ snapshots/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <commit-id>/
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
