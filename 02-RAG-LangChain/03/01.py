        page_content='\nThe 20th century witnessed the rise of some of the most influential scientists in history, with Albert Einstein and Marie Curie standing out among them. Einstein, best known for his theory of relativity, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Marie Curie, a pioneer in the study of radioactivity, was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radiation. Curie later made history again by winning a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discoveries of radium and polonium. Both scientists made monumental contributions that continue to influence the fields of physics and beyond.\n'
